Two kinds of objects created for this assignment:
1. 3D track with pylons
2. Leader board
3. TV screen showing track dynamically

Five other kinds of objects that you created:
3. Houses from past assignment (large, small, theater)
4. Cars from past assignment (Cybertruck, semi)
5. Construction equipment from past assignment (Backhoe, Truck crane, and crane/excavator (provided from WB))
6. Drone from past assignment
7. Trees from past assignment
8. Park objects from past assignment (carousel, top spin, and swing/roundabout (provided from WB))

At least on of each type of object:
Building/structure: House (2 types) and theater
Vehicle: 2 F1 cars, my Cybertruck and Tesla Semi
Natural Element: Tree

Object loaded from a model file:
Model: 
    - Two F1 cars   
    - Bleachers (to surround F1 track)
    - Construction building (for there to be a reason why the construction objects are there)

An object with a shader that you wrote:
ShaderObj: Added a random noise shader to the leader board to simulate static/pixelation that would be on a real display

Shader for track from here (did not write): https://thebookofshaders.com/edit.php?log=161128212019
