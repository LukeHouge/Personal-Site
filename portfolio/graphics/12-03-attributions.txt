    - The groundplane was created in Photoshop and all the textures combined onto each other. I started with the environment maps bottom image to try and make it match as much as possible. The image had to be significantly resized to make loading faster and is a little blurry if you zoom too far in. I wanted to include the high quality version but it was over 100MB and just took too long to load unfortunately.
