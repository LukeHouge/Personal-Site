My town's theme is an F1 track. I recently got into F1 and watching the Netflix show so I figured I would make an F1 track. I made the F1 track itself the main focus of my town, but also added things in around it just for some background, and things going on around. The F1 track itself has two cars going around, and their speeds randomized so sometimes one will be faster, and sometimes the other. I did this so it would be more of a race, and not just two cars going around at same or different speeds. There is a big leader board / jumbotron to display the current leader, number of laps done by each car, and their fastest laps. I also added a drone to "film" them, some bleachers, and left in the example track as sort of a mini F1 track that might be around at an actual event. There is a big empty parking lot next to it that the track goes over which I placed my semi in from a previous workbook, that would be like the teams transport vehicles or something. There is also a neighborhood with some houses, sidewalks, trees, cars parked on the driveways, etc. and a park next to it as well as some construction going on around. I also added an environment map which I tried to pick out because it was big and empty and not much going on so that it sort of added a realistic background to make things more interesting and real looking.
